# Procedural Tree Generation

This script generates semi-realistic trees. It is based on the algorithm described in [this blog](http://www.jgallant.com/procedurally-generating-trees-with-space-colonization-algorithm-in-xna/). To see it in action, run the runner.py script in the src folder.

At the moment the script can generate the branches, but no leaves are generated as yet. The tree can be saved as an image or as a 3d object
